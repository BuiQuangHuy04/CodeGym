# Flutter Project - Self-Practice Exercises

This project contains a collection of small applications written in Dart and Flutter. These are
exercises I have done to practice and improve my Flutter programming skills.

Each small application will illustrate one or more different aspects of Flutter, such as:

* Basic widgets and how to use them.
* State management.
* Event handling.
* Navigation.
* Working with data.
* ...

## How to run the application

1. Clone the project to your computer.
2. Open the project in an IDE (e.g., Android Studio, VS Code).
3. Run the application you want by selecting the corresponding `main.dart` file and pressing the Run
   button.

## Notes

* This project is under development and may be updated frequently.
* Any suggestions and contributions are welcome.
