# Brightness Control App

This simple Flutter app demonstrates how to control the brightness of a colored container and update
a counter using a button and a slider.

## Features

**Interactive Brightness Control:** A slider allows you to adjust the brightness of a blue colored
container in real-time.
**Counter:** A button increments a counter and displays the current count on the screen.
**Text Styling:** The counter value is displayed using a prominent headline style.

## How it Works

**State Management:** The app uses Flutter's `StatefulWidget` to manage the counter and brightness
values.
**Slider:** The `Slider` widget allows the user to interactively change the brightness value.
**Button:** The `FloatingActionButton` increments the counter when pressed.
**Text Widget:** The `Text` widget displays the current counter value.
**RichText and TextSpan:** The app uses `RichText` and `TextSpan` to style different parts of the
text differently.

3. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Android Studio, VS Code).
